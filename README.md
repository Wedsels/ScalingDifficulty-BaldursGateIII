Scales under-leveled enemies to the highest player level.

Since levels have no effect on enemies, this mod uses its own scaling system.
Each level an enemy gets scaled, they will gain:
- The proper Proficiency Bonus for their new level
- An HP increase of 8 + Consitution Modifier
- 1 additional Initiative
- 2 bonus to their highest physical stat ( Strength or Dexterity )
- 2 bonus to their Spellcasting Ability ( Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma )
- No change in rewarded experience

Works alongside any mod, and takes effect on any mod-added enemies.
Does not scale any players or recruitable characters.
Does scale any NPC ally or enemy.

Requires Script Extender.
Load order does not matter, place anywhere.
Can be installed and uninstalled freely.
